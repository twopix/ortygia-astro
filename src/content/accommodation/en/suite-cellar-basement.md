  Located on the basement level, the Suite Cellar accommodates up to 4 guests in an open-plan space designed with soft Cycladic curves and minimal, earthy finishes. The suite features two open-plan bedrooms with double beds, a fully equipped kitchen, A/C, TV, Wi-Fi, bath amenities, towels, and all the essentials for a comfortable and relaxing stay.

  A highlight of the suite is its beautifully crafted bathroom. With sculpted surfaces, gentle lighting, and a spacious shower area, it offers a soothing, spa-like bath experience - ideal for unwinding after your day in Mykonos.

  The aesthetic is rooted in clean Cycladic design, with warm ambient lighting, smooth lines, and natural textures that create a calming, boho-inspired atmosphere.

  Although the suite has no window or balcony, its thoughtful layout and serene ambience make it a cozy and intimate retreat for couples or friends.
